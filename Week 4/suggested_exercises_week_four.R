## 6.7.1 Inference for a single proportion ------------------

# 6.1 Vegetarian College Students
# a) False. Considering "being vegetarian" to be the "success" condition, it means that in a sample of 60 people,
# there's an expected number of 5 vegetarian, which is less than 10 successes, failing the success-failure test.
# b) True, since the expected number of vegetarians is low.
# c) No, since it falls within 2 standard errors of the expected value.
0.04/sqrt(0.08*0.92/125)

# d) Yes, since it would be more than 2 SEs
0.04/sqrt(0.08*0.92/250)

# e) No. It's 30% less.

# 6.3 Orange tabbies
p = 0.9
# a) Yes, since we have less than 10 failures.
p*30

# b) Yes.
# c) Yes, since it'll have more than 10 successes and 10 failures.
n = 140
n*p
n*(1-p)

# d) Yes, same reasoning as above.

# 6.9 Life after college.
succ = 348
n = 400
pop = 4500

# a) Parameter of interest is the proportion of students who finds jobs after graduation. Point estimate is 348/400 = 
p_hat = succ/n
p_hat

# b) 1. Independence: random sampling happens and 400<10% of 4500 students. 2. Sample size: check, since we have more than 10 successes
# and failures.

# c) The CI is (83.7%, 90.3%), which means that 95% of random samples would result
# in a 95% CI that include the true proportion of students.

se = sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n)
lower = p_hat - qnorm(p = 0.025, lower.tail = FALSE)*se
upper = p_hat + qnorm(p = 0.025, lower.tail = FALSE)*se
lower
p_hat
upper

# d) It means that 95% of the time, the true proportion falls inside that interval.
# There's a 5% chance (Type I error) that it doesn't.

# e) For the 99% CL, the interval is (82.7%, 91.3%).

lower = p_hat - qnorm(p = 0.005, lower.tail = FALSE)*se
upper = p_hat + qnorm(p = 0.005, lower.tail = FALSE)*se
lower
p_hat
upper

# f) 99% is wider, so that we have a higher chance of capturing the true proportion in the population.

# 6.11 Study Abroad
# a) Probably not. Since the sample was made using an optional web survey, it's
# probable that it has significant bias, so it probably isn't a representative 
# sample.

# b) CL = 90% is CI = (52.9%, 57.1%)
p_hat = 0.55
n = 1509
se = sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n)
lower = p_hat - qnorm(p = 0.05, lower.tail = FALSE)*se
upper = p_hat + qnorm(p = 0.05, lower.tail = FALSE)*se
lower
p_hat
upper

# c) It means that we're 90% sure that the true proportion of the population is
# in that interval.

# d) Yes.

# 6.13 Public option, Part I.
# a) CI is (47.1%, 56.9%) for 95% confidence. Which means that the data doesn't
# provide sufficient enough evidence to conclude that the majority of independts
# oppose the legislation.

p = 0.52
se = sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)
lower = p - qnorm(p = 0.025, lower.tail = FALSE)*se
upper = p + qnorm(p = 0.025, lower.tail = FALSE)*se

p
upper

# b) Yes.

# 6.15 Browsing in the mobile device
# a) H0: p = 38%, HA: p != 38%, SL = 5%
p = 0.17
p0 = 0.38
n = 2254
se = sqrt(p0*(1-p0)/n)
z = (p-p0)/se
z
pnorm(z)

# b) The p-value is extremely small, which means we can safely reject H0. In essence,
# the american proportion is different from 38%.

#c) For a 95% CL, the interval is (15.4%, 18.6%), which doesn't contain 38%.
p = 0.17
n = 2254
se = sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)
lower = p - qnorm(p = 0.025, lower.tail = FALSE)*se
upper = p + qnorm(p = 0.025, lower.tail = FALSE)*se

p
upper

# 6.19 College smokers
# a) Conditions: 1. Independence: random sample (check), n(200) <10% of population.
# 2. Sample size: more than 10% successes and fails in sample.
# CI is (14.4%, 25.6%), CL = 95%.
n = 200
p = 40/200
se = sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)
lower = p - qnorm(p = 0.025, lower.tail = FALSE)*se
upper = p + qnorm(p = 0.025, lower.tail = FALSE)*se
lower

# b) n = 1537 students
me = 0.02
z = -qnorm(0.025)
n_calc = z^2*p*(1-p)/me^2

# 6.21 Public option, Part II
# n = 6754 respondents.
me = 0.01

p = 0.52

## 6.7.2 Difference of two proportions ---------------------------------------


# 5.45 Coffee, depression and physical activity
# a) H0: All means are equal. HA: At least one pair of means differs from each other.
# b) We can assume random sampling was made, meaning that the observations are independent from each other. Normality may
# not be significant, since the values are never negative, so a right skew can be expected. The variances are almost equal
# between groups.
