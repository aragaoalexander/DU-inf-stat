## 6.7.1 Inference for a single proportion ------------------

# 6.1 Vegetarian College Students
# a) False. Considering "being vegetarian" to be the "success" condition, it means that in a sample of 60 people,
# there's an expected number of 5 vegetarian, which is less than 10 successes, failing the success-failure test.
# b) True, since the expected number of vegetarians is low.
# c) No, since it falls within 2 standard errors of the expected value.
0.04/sqrt(0.08*0.92/125)

# d) Yes, since it would be more than 2 SEs
0.04/sqrt(0.08*0.92/250)

# e) No. It's 30% less.

# 6.3 Orange tabbies
p = 0.9
# a) Yes, since we have less than 10 failures.
p*30

# b) Yes.
# c) Yes, since it'll have more than 10 successes and 10 failures.
n = 140
n*p
n*(1-p)

# d) Yes, same reasoning as above.

# 6.9 Life after college.
succ = 348
n = 400
pop = 4500

# a) Parameter of interest is the proportion of students who finds jobs after graduation. Point estimate is 348/400 = 
p_hat = succ/n
p_hat

# b) 1. Independence: random sampling happens and 400<10% of 4500 students. 2. Sample size: check, since we have more than 10 successes
# and failures.

# c) The CI is (83.7%, 90.3%), which means that 95% of random samples would result
# in a 95% CI that include the true proportion of students.

p_hat
upper

# d) It means that 95% of the time, the true proportion falls inside that interval.
# There's a 5% chance (Type I error) that it doesn't.

# e) For the 99% CL, the interval is (82.7%, 91.3%).

# f) 99% is wider, so that we have a higher chance of capturing the true proportion in the population.

# 6.11 Study Abroad
# a) Probably not. Since the sample was made using an optional web survey, it's
# probable that it has significant bias, so it probably isn't a representative 
# sample.

# b) CL = 90% is CI = (52.9%, 57.1%)

lower
p_hat
upper

# c) It means that we're 90% sure that the true proportion of the population is
# in that interval.

# d) Yes.

# 6.13 Public option, Part I.
# a) CI is (47.1%, 56.9%) for 95% confidence. Which means that the data doesn't
# provide sufficient enough evidence to conclude that the majority of independts
# oppose the legislation.

# b) The p-value is extremely small, which means we can safely reject H0. In essence,
# the american proportion is different from 38%.

#c) For a 95% CL, the interval is (15.4%, 18.6%), which doesn't contain 38%.

# a) Conditions: 1. Independence: random sample (check), n(200) <10% of population.

## 6.7.3 Testing for goodness of fit using chi-square --------------------------

# 6.39 True or false, part I.
# a) False, chi-square has one parameter: degrees of freedom.
# b) True.
# c) True.
# d) False, it becomes less skewed (more symmetrical).

# a) H0: there was no difference between the professor's predictions and what the
# students used in class. HA: There was a difference.

# 2. Sample size check (more than 5 expected cases for each scenario)

pchisq(q = chi, df = df, lower.tail = FALSE)

# e) p-value was 0.31, which menas that we can't reject H0. In other words, there's
# no difference between the professor's expectations and the observations.

## 6.7.5 Small sample hypothesis testing for a proportion ----------------------

# 6.51 Bullying in schools.
# No, it's not. There's only 9 successes in the sample, meaning that the Sample
# Size condition isn't fullfilled.

# 6.53 The Egyptian Revolution.
# a) H0: p_hs = 0.69, HA: p_hs != 0.69
# b)
p_hs = 17/30

# c) Supposing the null hypothesis is true, we'd have 21 successes and 9 failures,
# which doesn't fulfill the sample size condition.

fail = (1-0.69)*30

# d)
pvalue = pbinom(17, 30, 0.69)*2
pvalue

# pvalue is 0.10, which is higher than 0.05 (CL 95%). This means that we can't reject
# H0, or that we can't reject the hypothesis that the proportion of HS students
# who followed news about Egypt is 69%.

# e) ????

#6.55 Social Experiment, Part II
# a) H0: ppr - pcon = 0, HA: ppr - pcon != 0.
# b)

# c) estimated pvalue = 0.04
